<h1>Creating VM instances (Azure)<h1>
<li>	> The first of my objectives in completing my project entailed using Microsoft Azure to develop and configure a Virtual Machine (VM) instance.I configured the Vms to enable connection via the server manager.<li> 
<ul>
<h1>2. Creating a Vnet with two Subnets<h1>
<li>	> with a /24 network prefix there are 256 IPv4 addresses available<li>
<li>	> Each subnet is -2 from the number of host addresses<li>
<li>	> I created vms in subnets and configured their connections (Designated IPs)<li>
<li>	> I kept record of vm, subnets, and subnet vms via network topology<li>
<li>	> I used ping to verify connectivity between vms<li>
<ul>
<h1>3. Configuring NSG<h1>
<li>	> I configured a set of port rules via the "networking" settings tab of my host vm. (Allow/Deny)<li>
<ul>
<h1>4. Creating and managing files for cloud network storage<h1>
<li>	> Establish Access Tiers (Hot, Cool, and Archive)<li>
<li>	> The "Access Tier" setting optimizes storage costs by placing data in appropriate access tier.<li> 
<ul>
<h1>5. Creating Blob Snapshots<h1>
<li>	> I recorded photos for each parts of this project that caption explanations of certain steps. Majority of the steps for creating and managing snapshots are in photographs stored in another branch of the repository.<li> 
<ul>
<h1>6. VM Monitoring<h1>
<li>	> I created the VM-status-change group, which was then listed in the manage actions page.<li>
<li>	> I configured a set of alert rules for the host VM to notify admin about status updates, VM restarts, VM allocations, etc.<li> 
<li>	> I made sure to test the notification efficiency of my alerts using the "VM_Restart" alert rule (connected to student email)<li>
<ul>
<h1>7. Challenges<h1>
<li>	> I so very much enjoyed completing this project so it was difficult to find a challenge (Finding a pattern here). Although, One challenge I have had through the entire duration of completing this project was containing my excitement to complete it each week. On a serious note, I made a small mistake at a certain point in the project that made completing it a little more of a task than anticipated. There was a point in the project where while following my instructions I became distracted and didn’t follow the proper guidelines as far as deletion. I had to backtrack and reassess where it was I went wrong which essentially was not deleting the VM’s and resource group I had generated previously. This led to me reaching the storage limit of my Devry student account on Azure. Luckily I received notification of  this event in trying to generate more resource groups and VMs and knew to backtrack to my logs and delete old components.<li> 
<ul>
<h8>8. Career Skills Obtained (Azure)<li>
<li>	> Generating Virtual Machine (VM) Instances<li>
<li>	> Building a VNET containing a host VM and Subnets<li>
<li>	> Generating and configuring Network security groups (NSG) for the VNET<li>
<li>	> Generating and maintaining Cloud Storage (Uploading, Editing, Arranging files)<li>
<li>	> Generating and assigning alerts to various actions, changes, and states for efficient administrator notification and monitoring<li>
<ul>
<h9>9. Conclusion<h1>
<li>	> As I have stated before, I thoroughly enjoyed completing this project just as I have every other I have completed. I am thankful for each person who will review and be able to utilize this information and my experiences in the future. I also deeply appreciate my professors and fellow classmates who have been a support to me and my education whether they know the impact or not. Thanks again to all of you!<li>
