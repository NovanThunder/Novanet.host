<h1>INVENTORY<h1>
<li>	> ESP 32 Board<li>
<li>	> Color LEDs: Red, Yellow, Green, and BLue<li>
<li>	> 220 OHM Resistors (Optional)<li>
<li>	> Wires<li>
<li>	> Breadboard(s)<li>
<li>	> LCD unit with I2C Adapter<li>
<li>	> Active Buzzer<li>
<li>	> Mini Router<li> 
<li>	> Push Button(s)<li> 
<li>	> PIR Motion Sensor<li>
<ul>
<h1>1.CONFIGURE ESP32 MICROCONTROLLER ON ASSEMBLED BREADBOARDS<h1>
<li>	> I connected the microprocessor in between two breadboard in which both had a side removed to accomodate connection.<li>
<ul>
<h1>2.INSTALL ARDUINO IDE AND CONNECT TO ESP32 MICROPROCESSOR<h1>
<li>	> In the Arduino IDE tools menu I was able to select the board and port connected to the ESP32 and ensure connectivity.<li>  
<ul>
<h1>3.ESP32 WIFI SCAN<h1>
<li>	> I input the proper code for ESP32 to run a scan of available wifi networks. (Code provided by Devry University)<li>
<li>	> Included in my gallery are screenshots of my serial monitor on Arduino IDE displaying the available wifi networks.<li>
<ul>
<h1>4.CREATING THE CONTROLLER<h1>
<li>	> Next I assembled the controller with the following components:<li>
<li>	   1.ESP 32 Board<li>
<li>	   2.Color LEDs: RED, YELLOW AND GREEN<li>
<li>	   3.220 OHM Resistors (Optional)<li>
<li>	   4.Wires<li>
<li>	   5.Breadboard<li>
<li>	> Screenshots of assembly located in gallery<li>
<li>	> The assembled controller contained the microcrontoller that runs a program telling the LED's to act as traffic lights.<li>
<h1>5.CREATING A MULTIPLE TRAFFIC LIGHT CONTROLLER<h1>
<li>	> My next order of business was to acquire and program a new code into the ESP32 telling it to act as a traffic light controller for two separate sets of traffic lights.<li>
<li>	> The updated code provided by Devry University made it so the LEDs were lit in the best order for them to act as two corresponding traffic lights at a single intersection.<li>
<li>	> Screenshots of the assmembly and code are all located in the gallery.<li>
<li>	> Additional wires and LEDs were added to accomodate.<li>
<ul>
<h1>6.ADDING CROSSWALK BUTTON TO TRAFFIC LIGHT ASSEMBLY<h1>
<li>	> At this point in the project I added just a few components to ensure proper functionality of my cross walk button.<li>
<li>	   1.Push Button<li>
<li>	   2.Wires<li>
<li>	> I also had to apply another updated code to accomodate for the functionality of the push button. (code provided by Devry University)<li>
<li>	> Upon pushing the push button in my traffic light assembly, the red LEDs will glow and the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE will then display the walk timer counting down from 10 in real time.<li>
<li>	> There are screenshots of both the code input and serial monitor in my gallery.<li>
<ul>
<h1>PEER REVIEW<h1>
<li>	> To complete my project I was instructed to conduct a peer review with my classmates via our Discussion Board.The objective of the peer review was for me to both review and comment on my peers responses to questions in the discussion board. Here are a list of the Questions we were to answer and comment on:<li>
<li>	   1.As discussed in the lesson, security breaches are happening more and more often, and are affecting tens of millions of people: do an internet search to find recent events of security breaches and discuss your findings with relevant examples.<li>
<li>	   2.Think fo something that would make your life easier,ANything from an automatic toothpaste dispenser to an awning that opens up when it senses rain, and imagine how you could actually create it. Do you agree with massimo that the Arduino makes microcontrollers and coding available to anyone, regardless of experience?
<li>	> I was then to do a peer review reflection where I am to display my response to a question as well as a comment from a peer.<li>
<li>	> Screenshots of mine and my classmates repsonses can be found in my gallery.<li>
<ul>
<h1>CHALLENGES<h1>
<li>	>I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THE ASSEMBLY OF THIS PROJECT SO IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AND HOLD TO MUCH OF A CHALLENGE. ONE SMALL MISTAKE I MADE DURING MY ASSEMBLY PROCESS WAS NOT PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THE PROPER DISTINGUISHMENT OF PORTS ON THE NODE32 MICROPROCESSOR, LEDS, AND BREADBOARDS. THERE WAS A POINT I HAD COME TO THE REALIZATION THAT I HAD CERTAIN WIRES CONNECTED TO THE WRONG PORTS AND REFERRED TO MY PROJECT GUIDES FROM PREVIOUS WEEKS TO RECONFIGURE THEM THE CORRECT WAY.<li>
<h1>CAREER SKILLS<h1>
<li>	>ONE MAJOR TAKEAWAY FROM COMPLETING THIS PROJECT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF CIRCUITRY AND IMPLEMENTING FUNCTIONALITY OF ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF DEVICES. I AM ONLY FAR MORE EXCITED TO TAKE MORE COURSES AND GAIN FURTHER EXPERIENCE IN COMPLETING THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS ON MY OWN. MY ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO BUILD AND OWN MY OWN TECH COMPANY, SO I NATURALLY ABSORB EVERY MOMENT AS IF MY DESIRED FUTURE DEPENDS ON IT. MY INTENT ALONE SHOULD THOROUGHLY DESCRIBE WHAT CAREER SKILLS I HAVE ACCUMULATED FROM COMPLETING THIS PROJECT BEING THAT THESE ALONE ARE MY OPPORTUNITY TO GET HANDS ON PRACTICE WITH SAID CONCEPTS.<li>
<ul>
<li>I ENJOYED COMPLETING THIS PROJECT AND WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR PROFESSOR MORTEZAIE AND MY FELLOW CLASSMATES!<li>
