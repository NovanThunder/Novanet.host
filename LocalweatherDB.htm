<h1>FLOW CHART<h1>
<li>	>START<li>
<li>	   1. Install Python<li>
<li>	   2. Download weather data to a database
<li>	   3. Extract weather data from database into a comma separated file with python<li>
<li>	   4. Cleanse Weather Data<li>
<li>	   5. Use Excel to manipulate data<li>
<li>	>END<li>
<ul>
<h1>SOFTWARE INVENTORY<h1>
<li>	>Ensured that I had NOAA-SDK library installed via pip install<li>
<li>	>Screenshots available separate branch of repository<li>
<ul>
<h1>DOWNLOADING WEATHER DATA<h1>
<li>	>I developed the BuildWeatherDb.py database by plugging in the necessary code as provided by Devry univeristy<li> 
<li>	>I recorded screenshots of a successful program execution to verify it's connectivity to real time library.<li>
<li>	>I then saved the programmed BuildWeatherDb.py and saved it to the weather.db file<li>
<h1>QUERYING THE DATABASE WITH SQL<h1>
<li>	>Under my professor's instruction, i was able to use SQl to query reception of all columns and rows, highest and lowest temperatures, and/or all clear days.<li>
<li>	>Screenshots available in separate branch of repository<li>
<h1>EXTRACTING HUMIDITY DATA<h1>
<li>	>I created the ExtractTempHumidity.py after successfully running the necessary code procided by Devry University<li>
<h1>RETRIEVE AND CONVERT DATA TO CSV FORMAT<h1>
<h1>	>Under instruction of my professor I was told to convert database files into excel readable spreadsheets.<li>
<li>	>Using excel I was able to chart data according to whats being generated by my dabases.<li>
<h1>DEVELOPING GRAPHICAL MODELS AND INTERPRETING RESULTS<h1>
<li>	>I have screenshots of various graphs based on real data generated from my database in a separate branch of my repository.<li>
<li>	   1.Scatter Plot<li>
<li>	   2.Histogram<li>
<li>	>I then generated an analysis page comparing graphs for temprature in farenheit and humidity.<li>
<h1>ANALYSIS<h1>
<li>	>The weather is composed of cool temperatures with high humidity. The chart shows that over 90 days leading into November there is an unexpected increase in temperature, leading to more moisture being evaporated from the previously cooled atmosphere.<li>  
<ul>
<li>	>The Humidity chart displays the increase in humidity approaching the end of a 90 day period in mid November<li>
<ul>
<li>	>The Fahrenheit Chart displays the sudden increase in temperature within a 2-week period.<li>
<h1>PREDICTION<h1>
<li>	>Today (11/29/2022) in-particular is a little warmer outside than it has been the past week and certainly over the past few hours (Currently Noon). One can assume the humidity level would display another sudden increase when charted, and I can predict that the humidity would drop once again once the sun goes down and the wind picks up in support of that forementioned chart. I can imagine that the hours leading up to the sun falling low, the humidity would remain just around where it is currently plateaued (If not increased from constant increased temperature for periods of time).<li>
<h1>CONCLUSION<h1>
<li>	>The weather had drastically cooled over the weeks of completing this project. My prediction had been incorrect, yet the details explaining my prediction were accurate. There has been almost no humidity locally being that there has been such drastic drops in temperature even during the daytime. Many days have been cloudy without rain but coincidentally it rained the night before completing this project and snow has been forecasted for later in the week.<li>
<h1>CHALLENGES<h1>
<li>	>I had encountered a couple issues completing my project, but nothing a little help from Prof. Wang couldn’t fix. I originally believed that I had been taking things step by step carefully and that I wouldn’t have much trouble. It was as I continued through the project that I started having issues. It was difficult for me to troubleshoot these issues on my own being that I was so sure I was doing each step correctly. It was when I contacted Prof. Wang for help that I had it brought to my attention that I had skipped a small yet very significant step in assembling my queries. In fixing this issue I had realized just how vital each detail is and how each file depends on the last file’s configuration.<li>
<h1>CAREERS SKILLS OBTAINED
<li>	>This entire project has been non-stop learning from beginning to end. It started with completing my course work and learning what Python is, how it’s used, and how important it is globally. In learning how to speak to machines there comes a great deal of capabilities. For instance, completing this project has taught me how to use Python programming language on Spyder to develop a Weather Information Database then query the accumulated data for storage. This type of knowledge can be the most beneficial for those with intent to get into the Data Analytics field.<li>
